<p>Superposition is a hackathon aimed at high school and college females (trans and non-binary inclusive) in the bay area of all experience levels and backgrounds. As the tech director, I created the Superposition IV Website using HTML, CSS, JS.  Through this project, I have learned more about mobile-responsive design, css animations, and using javascript functions. View site here: https://superposition.tech/ </p>
